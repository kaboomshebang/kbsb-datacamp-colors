# DataCamp Notebook Colors extension

Good use of color and contrast can enhance the readability of interfaces. However, in comparison to other notebook styles, the low contrast colors used by DataCamp did not feel optimal. To address this, I created a small Chrome browser-extension that modifies the colors and styling of the DataCamp notebook cells.

> Compatible with Chrome based browsers. Tested on Brave and Chrome.

Checkout this [DataCamp notebook](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/5b0ad017-201c-490c-b40e-5169e02cad9e) for more information.

## Preview

The new style makes a clear distinction between activated and non-activated cells. This is achieved by using a thicker and darker border to provide a clear visual separation. This helps to improve the keyboard navigation. The use of different background colors for code, output, and markdown cells helps to enhance the readability of the notebook.
