# DataCamp Notebook Colors extension

Good use of color and contrast can enhance the readability of interfaces. However, in comparison to other notebook styles, the low contrast colors used by DataCamp did not feel optimal. To address this, I created a small Chrome browser-extension that modifies the colors and styling of the DataCamp notebook cells.

> Compatible with Chrome based browsers. Tested on Brave and Chrome.
